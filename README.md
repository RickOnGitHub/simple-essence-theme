# Simple Essence Theme

A stripped-down, developer-first WordPress theme built for performance, clarity, and full control.

**Simple Essence** removes the bloat of the standard WordPress frontend—no unnecessary styles, scripts, or head clutter. It's designed as a lightweight foundation for developers who want a clean slate to build custom themes without fighting default behaviors.
